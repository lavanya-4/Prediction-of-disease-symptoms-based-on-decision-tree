# Prediction of Disease Symptoms Based on Decision Tree

This project uses a decision tree algorithm to predict diseases based on symptom input data. It is a simple machine learning application designed for educational and demonstration purposes.

## 📊 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for Decision Tree Classifier)

## 📁 Project Structure
- Loads symptom-disease mapping dataset from local/Google Drive
- Preprocesses and visualizes the dataset
- Trains a Decision Tree model to classify diseases based on symptom inputs
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository or upload the notebook to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
2. Ensure your dataset is available on Google Drive and mounted properly.
3. Run all cells sequentially to train the model and make predictions.

## 📌 Note
- The accuracy and effectiveness of the predictions depend heavily on the dataset quality and feature preprocessing.
- This project is a prototype and not intended for clinical or diagnostic use.
